I believe great documentation is inseparable from great software. A product might be powerful under the hood, but without clear guides, structured references, and well-thought-out onboarding, users struggle to realize its full value. Thatâ€™s where I come in.

If youâ€™re:

A startup looking to build trust with your users through clean, beginner-friendly guides.
An open-source maintainer who needs structured documentation that attracts contributors.
A tech team searching for a partner to design onboarding docs, API references, or internal knowledge bases.

Then we can work together to make your product easier to adopt, use, and love.
I bring:

- Clarity: turning complex software or data into simple, structured stories.
- Consistency: aligning docs with your product branding and tone.
- Scalability: designing docs that grow with your platform, from v1 to enterprise-ready.


ðŸ“© Reach out â€” letâ€™s make your product easier to understand, one document at a time.Whether itâ€™s freelance projects, open-source collaborations, or ongoing documentation support â€” Iâ€™m excited to help teams bridge the gap between builders and users.
