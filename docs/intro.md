title: About Me
---

I’m Cammie, a documentation engineer passionate about making technology accessible through clear, structured, and user-friendly documentation.

I specialize in turning complex software and data into straightforward guides, tutorials, and references that help users quickly understand and adopt technical products.

## Areas I Work In
- **AI for Docs**: applying AI tools to improve the efficiency and accuracy of documentation.
- **API Documentation**: writing clear endpoint references, examples, and usage guides for developers.
- **Automation Workflows**: designing documentation that supports CI/CD pipelines and streamlines technical processes.
- **DevOps & Cloud Docs**: creating documentation for deployments, infrastructure, and cloud services.
- **Documentation Tooling**: building modern documentation sites with tools like Docusaurus.
- **Web3 Documentation**: simplifying decentralized technologies for end-users and developers.

## Portfolio

During the WriteTech Accelerator Program, I worked on multiple documentation projects that cut across these areas. These projects range from:

- Audits of existing open-source documentation (evaluating structure and clarity).
- Docs-as-Code projects built with Docusaurus.
- API references designed for readability and developer onboarding.
- Getting-Started guides for new users exploring software tools.

This portfolio is a growing space where I’ll continue adding my work as I expand into more technical domains.
