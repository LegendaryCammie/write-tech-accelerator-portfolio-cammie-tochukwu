title: My WriteTech Accelerator Portfolio
---

### Welcome! 🎉 

This portfolio showcases the projects I completed during the WriteTech Accelerator Program — a hands-on bootcamp designed to sharpen technical writing skills across modern domains.

Throughout the program, I worked on documentation projects spanning API docs, AI-for-docs, DevOps & Cloud, automation workflows, and Web3, using industry-standard practices like the Docs-as-Code approach and tools such as Docusaurus.
