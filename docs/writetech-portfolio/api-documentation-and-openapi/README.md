# API Documentation Project – Cammie Tochukwu’s Reflection   

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of my **WriteTech Accelerator journey**, where I’m learning to go beyond “just writing” and really step into the role of a **documentation engineer**.  

For this milestone, I worked with the **Chimoney API**, documenting key endpoints such as:  
- Wallet Details  
- Wallet Transfer  
- Wallet Transfer Quotes  
- Add Beneficiary  

The goal wasn’t just to describe endpoints, but to show how documentation can guide someone from **confusion to clarity** — with clear examples, structured notes, and realistic error handling.  

---

## 🎯 Goals I Set for Myself  
- Follow through on every milestone, even when I fall behind.  
- Learn to test APIs in **Postman** and not just read about them.  
- Build docs that balance **accuracy and accessibility**.  
- Practice the discipline of showing up consistently, no matter the challenges.

## 💡 My Growth Journey  

This project was far from perfect — and that’s exactly why it matters to me.  

- **Catching Up After Missing Class:** I missed the live session, so I relied heavily on recordings, extra research, and tools like AI to fill in the gaps. It wasn’t easy, but it forced me to learn in my own way.  
- **Late Nights & Persistence:** I stayed up late more than once, piecing things together step by step. It reminded me that learning a new skill is often messy, but the consistency pays off.  
- **Missed Deadlines, Not My Goal:** I may have missed the official deadline, but I refused to let that be the end of it. This project is proof that I’m committed to **finishing what I start** and honoring this technical writing journey.  
- **Problem-Solving Mindset:** Every 401, 404, or broken config became a lesson. Instead of frustration, I treated them as teaching moments that would eventually make my docs stronger.

## 🛠️ What I Actually Did  
- Documented **Chimoney API endpoints** with:  
  - Clear overviews  
  - Request/response samples  
  - Error cases (with fixes)  
  - Notes and tips to guide developers  
- Structured docs into:  
  - **Introduction** (what APIs are, why docs matter, why this project)  
  - **Getting Started** (auth, first API calls, Postman setup)  
  - **API Reference** (wallets, transfers, beneficiaries, quotes)  
- Used recordings, research, and AI tools as extra support to build out gaps in my understanding.  
- Added this README for reflection, which won’t appear on the site but captures my process honestly.

## ✨ Lessons I’ll Carry Forward  
- **Progress > Perfection:** Even if I miss a class or deadline, I can still catch up and grow.  
- **Independence Matters:** Relying on recordings, research, and tools showed me I can figure things out when I don’t have live guidance.  
- **Consistency Wins:** Late nights may be tiring, but they’re proof that I can stay disciplined when it matters.  
- **Docs Are Bridges:** A good doc doesn’t just explain an API - it helps someone move from stuck to successful.  

---

## 🌱 Final Reflection  
This project represents more than just API documentation. It represents **resilience, discipline, and self-trust**.  

I learned that even when I fall behind, I can **still catch up, still finish, and still grow**. I’m proud that this README doesn’t paint a picture of perfection, but of persistence.  

This is just one step in my journey, but it’s proof that I’m sticking to my commitment: to not just write, but to build, to debug, and to document with clarity.
