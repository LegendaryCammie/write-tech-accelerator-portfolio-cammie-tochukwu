# Introduction

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the building blocks of modern software.  
They allow different systems to talk to each other ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a banking app fetching your account balance, an e-commerce site processing payments, or a logistics platform tracking deliveries.  

Without APIs, most of the seamless digital experiences we take for granted today wouldn‚Äôt exist.  

But APIs on their own can be complex. This is where **good documentation** comes in. Clear documentation explains not just what an API does, but how to use it, what errors to expect, and how to troubleshoot them. In short: it transforms raw endpoints into something **developers can trust and build with**.

## Purpose of This Project

This project was created as part of my **API documentation learning journey**. The goal was to take a real API, explore how it works, and then document it in a way that is **structured, detailed, and developer-friendly**.  

For this exercise, I worked with the **Chimoney API** - an API that powers digital payments such as wallet lookups, transfers, and beneficiary management.  

Through this documentation, I show:  
- ‚úÖ How to get started with the API.  
- üîë How authentication works.  
- üìå Examples of key endpoints (wallet details, transfers, quotes, etc).  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Common errors and how to resolve them.

## Why This Matters

This wasn‚Äôt just about writing reference pages. It was about understanding:  
- How APIs are used in real-world business cases (like fintech and payments).  
- What developers need to see to adopt an API quickly.  
- How to balance technical detail with clarity.  

By the end, the documentation should feel approachable to someone new, but still detailed enough for developers working on integrations.
