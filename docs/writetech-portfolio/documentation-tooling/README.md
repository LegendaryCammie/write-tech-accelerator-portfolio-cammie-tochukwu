# 📖 Documentation Tooling Project – Cammie Tochukwu’s Reflection  

## Project Overview  
This project is part of my journey in the **WriteTech Accelerator Program**, where I explored how documentation is more than just writing text - it’s about building usable, structured, and navigable resources.  

For this milestone, I documented a sample API (`jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`) using **Docusaurus**.  

---

## 🎯 Goals I Set for Myself  
- Learn to actually *think like a documentation engineer*, not just a writer.  
- Understand how to organize content into sidebars, categories, and modules.  
- Document API endpoints in a way that feels beginner-friendly and structured.  
- Face errors head-on instead of avoiding them (my big growth point).

## 💡 My Growth Journey  

This project wasn’t smooth sailing — and that’s where I grew the most.  

- **Battling Errors:** I kept running into sidebar and doc ID issues, and honestly felt stuck more than once. At first it was frustrating, but I realized debugging is *part of documentation engineering*. Each error I solved boosted my confidence.  
- **Learning the Tools:** I went from “Markdown writer” to someone who can configure a Docusaurus site, fix navigation issues, and restructure content logically. That’s a huge leap.  
- **Structured Thinking:** I started appreciating how categories, overviews, and intros shape the reader’s experience. A single misplaced file could make the whole site confusing.

##  What I Actually Did  
- Built a documentation structure with:  
  - **Overview (Intro)**  
  - **Getting Started Guide**  
  - **API Reference (with endpoints like GET User, POST Transaction)**  
- Added reflections (like this README) that live in the repo but not on the site.  
- Experimented with categories for different modules in the WriteTech portfolio.  

---

## ✨ Lessons I’ll Carry Forward  
- **Docs = Problem Solving:** It’s not just about writing; it’s about troubleshooting, organizing, and designing.  
- **Errors Are Teachers:** Every time Docusaurus yelled at me, I left smarter than before.  
- **Think About the Reader:** Structure isn’t decoration — it’s how you respect your user’s time.  

---

## Final Reflection  
This project was less about “just finishing” and more about **becoming comfortable with discomfort**.  

I can now say I don’t just write; I *build* docs. I wrestle with tools, I debug, I reorganize — and that makes me stronger.  

Next step? Adding visuals, polishing my style, and building a portfolio that shows not just what I wrote, but what I overcame to make it work.
