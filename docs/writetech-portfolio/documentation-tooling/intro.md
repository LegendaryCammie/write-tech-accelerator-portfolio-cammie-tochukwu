# Documentation Tooling Overview
In modern technical writing, documentation is no longer treated as an afterthought. Instead, writers and developers follow the Docs-as-Code approach — managing documentation with the same tools and processes used in software engineering.

This means:
- 📂 Docs live in version control (Git/GitHub), making every change traceable.
- ✍🏽 Markdown and lightweight markup languages are used for easy authoring.
- ✅ Linters and automated checks enforce style and quality.
- ⚡ Continuous integration pipelines can preview, test, and even publish documentation automatically.
- 🌍 Static Site Generators (SSGs) like Docusaurus make it easy to publish docs as sleek, searchable websites.

The result is documentation that is collaborative, scalable, and developer-friendly — a perfect match for fast-moving projects.

## JSONPlaceholder API Documentation

To put these principles into practice, I worked on the JSONPlaceholder API as part of my WriteTech Accelerator portfolio.

This project demonstrates how I can take a simple public API and transform it into **clear, structured, and beginner-friendly technical documentation.**

---

## What is JSONPlaceholder?
JSONPlaceholder is a free fake REST API that developers often use for prototyping, testing, or learning how to interact with APIs.

It provides endpoints for common resources such as:
- 👤 Users
- 📝 Posts
- 💬 Comments
- 📸 Photos
- 📂 Albums
- ✅ Todos

---

## Purpose of this Project
The goal was not to rewrite JSONPlaceholder’s docs, but to reorganize and simplify them so they feel approachable for someone who is:

- Just starting to learn about REST APIs.
- Practicing making API calls with tools like Postman, curl, or JavaScript’s fetch().
- Curious about how structured documentation is built and maintained.
---

## What’s Inside
- **Getting Started**: A quick guide to making your first call.
- **API Reference**: Focused examples of common endpoints, like fetching a user or creating a post.
- **Reflection**: Notes on what I learned while building this documentation.

## Why This Matters

This project was more than a documentation exercise. It was a chance to:
- Apply Docs-as-Code principles in a real-world scenario.
- Practice using Docusaurus to structure and publish documentation.
- Show how good documentation can turn a raw API into something useful and user-friendly.
